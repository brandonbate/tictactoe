# tictactoe

This is a web application for playing tic-tac-toe. It's an ASGI application programmed in Django. I was able to run it
successfully with:

* ```Python 3.10.10```
* ```Django 4.1.7```
* ```Redis 5.0```
* ```daphne 4.0.0```
* ```channels 3.0.5```
* ```channels-redis 3.4.1```

It does not work well with ```channels-redis 4.0.0``` for unknown reasons. This programm was inspired by the
[Channels Tutorial](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial).
